    <h1>Rajgad Fort</h1>
    <br />
    <p>
      <b>Rajgad</b> literal meaning ruling fort is a Hill region fort situated in the
      Pune district of Maharashtra, India. Formerly known as Murumbdev, the fort
      was the first capital of the Maratha Empire under the rule of Chhatrapati
      Shivaji for almost 26 years, after which the capital was moved to the
      Raigad Fort.[1] Treasures discovered from an adjacent fort called Torna
      were used to completely build and fortify the Rajgad Fort.
